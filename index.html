    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>SMS SPAM FILTERING - I implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and text cleaning techniques to ensure high accuracy in spam detection, culminating in the development of an SMS spam classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Leveraging TF-IDF for feature extraction, I employed machine learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to effectively classify spam messages. By integrating NLP techniques and advanced algorithms, I successfully built a robust SMS spam detection model capable of accurately identifying and filtering out unwanted messages. This project highlights my expertise in combining data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning to solve real-world classification problems.</li>
      <li>EVALUATING SHALLOW and DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS FOR 
NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEMS IN CYBER SECURITY - I evaluated both shallow and deep neural networks for network intrusion detection, conducting a thorough comparison of their accuracy and efficiency on cybersecurity datasets. By applying feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model optimization techniques, I enhanced the detection performance of the models. Additionally, I analyzed the results to identify key trade-offs between computational complexity and detection accuracy, ensuring an optimal balance for real-world deployment. This work demonstrates my ability to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to address critical challenges in cybersecurity.</li>
      <li>AI-DRIVEN STOCK MARKET PREDICTION and INVESTMENT INSIGHTS 
SYSTEM - The project aimed to develop an AI model capable of analyzing historical stock data, identifying patterns, and predicting future stock prices using advanced machine learning techniques. By incorporating sentiment analysis, technical indicators, and fundamental analysis, the model provided actionable insights to assist investors in making informed decisions. Additionally, the system was designed to integrate live market data, enabling continuous updates to predictions and recommendations for accurate and timely investment strategies. This approach not only enhanced the precision of stock price forecasts but also empowered investors with data-driven tools to navigate dynamic market conditions effectively.</li>
